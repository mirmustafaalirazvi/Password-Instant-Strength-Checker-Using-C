# Password-Instant-Strength-Checker-Using-C


 A simple and effective console-based C application that checks the strength of a user-entered password based on common security rules.
This project was developed as part of my BCA 1st Semester – C Programming coursework.

This application evaluates a password using the following criteria:

 •	Minimum length of 8 characters
 •	At least one uppercase letter
 •	At least one lowercase letter
 •	At least one digit
 •	At least one special character

 Based on these conditions, the password is classified as:
 
 •	Weak
 •	Medium
 •	Strong
 
 
 
 ⚙️ Technologies Used
